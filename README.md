A simple admin tool for inspecting rewrite rules.

## Description

A simple WordPress admin tool for inspecting rewrite rules. View a listing of all your rewrite rules, see which rewrite rules match a given URL (and the priorites they match in), or filter by different sources of rewrite rules. Perform a soft flush of your rewrite rules to regenerate them.

Originally developed for clients hosted at [WordPress VIP](https://wpvip.com/), we thought it would be useful for development environments, etc. too. Feel free to [fork the plugin in GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/Rewrite-Rules-Inspector/) â€” pull requests are always welcome. Hit us with feedback, questions, bug reports, and feature requests in the GitHub issues.
